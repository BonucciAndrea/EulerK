# Project Euler with K: Learn by Solving!

This repository is dedicated to learning the K programming language by tackling Project Euler problems.

# What is K?

K is a concise, high-performance array language, developed for fast processing of large data sets. Its terse syntax allows you to express complex ideas in just a few keystrokes, making it ideal for algorithmic challenges and financial computations.

# Repository Overview

In this repository, you will find solutions to various problems from Project Euler, a collection of challenging mathematical/computational problems. Each problem serves as an opportunity to explore K's unique capabilities, such as:

  - Array manipulation and slicing
  - Functional programming constructs
  - High-performance operations on large datasets

# Structure

  - Problem Files: Each Project Euler problem will have its own file (e.g., problem1.k, problem2.k) that contains the problem statement, followed by a solution implemented in K.
  - Comments & Explanations: Each file includes comments explaining the thought process behind the solution and highlights key K language features used.

# Why K + Euler?

Project Euler's problems are a fantastic way to get hands-on with the language and understand its strengths, especially when it comes to handling large arrays, functional paradigms, and mathematical computation.
